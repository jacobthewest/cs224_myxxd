// Below is how you see the output from your xxd file

    cat test_file_thing.txt | xxd > where_you_want_the_xxd_results.txt

// Below is how you see the output from your myxxd.c file

       // Note: you firt need to compile your file with "gcc -Wall -g myxxd.c -o myxxd"

    cat test_file_thing.txt | ./myxxd > where_you_want_the_myxxd.c_results.txt

// Now you get to compare the two files by doing this...

    diff where_you_want_the_xxd_results.txt where_you_want_the_myxxd.c_results.txt

        // Then you get a bunch of output below
